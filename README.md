# Raspberry Pi cooling fan controller

A Raspberry Pi doesn't exactly need a cooling fan. But is cool to see a Pi programmatically control a fan. Moreover, a cool breeze now and then doesn't harm.

What may really harm a Pi, however, is a fan directly connected to the GPIO. A simple transistor based circuit is used to power the fan externally.
